rules: |
  In Tic-Tac-Toe, you and the computer take turns marking squares on a board.
    In order to win, you need to mark three squares in a row either vertically,
    horizontally, or diagonally. The first player to successfully mark three
    squares in a row wins the round and gets one point. The round ends either
    when someone wins or the board is filled.

    The first player to reach %{score} points (default), or the number of points you 
    choose, wins the game. No points will be awarded for tie games.

    You may choose who moves first for the first round. The loser will start 
    the next round. If the round ends in a tie, the player with fewer points 
    will start the next round.

    Good luck!
