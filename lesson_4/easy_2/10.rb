What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

- Allows for abstraction, which provides a high-level, natural-language way to think about problems by breaking the program into classes with logical names. 'BankAccount', 'Person', etc.
- Provides data protection by encapsulating data into an object, and providing method access control to selectively expose that data throughout the program.
- Lets us define a method once that potentially many classes can respond to (polymorphism)
- Provides organization for code (namespacing)
- Allows us to create our own custom classes / data types


LS Solution:

  1. Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
  2. Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
  3. It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
  4. It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
  5. We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
  6. As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
